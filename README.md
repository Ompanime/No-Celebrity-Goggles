This Goggle was created to help combat the underlying influece popculture and celebrities have on our society. If you're interested in seeing what search results look
like without popculture influence, try out these goggles [here](https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOmpanime%2FNo-Celebrity-Goggles%2Fmain%2FNo%2520Celebrity%2520Goggles)!

This Goggle is publicly available at no cost to the user, and is suitable for modification and redistribution under the GNU General Public License v3.0. Leaving this project open sourced will allow others to improve on an already established project/codebase.

I hope that this project will improve your life!
